1. Where There is a will, there is a way
The key to success is not so much money but a strong will. A great man is one who has a strong will and indomitable spirit. In other words, if a man does not have a stong will to win get the final victory, he will never succeed in his life. He is no more than a failure.
It is quite obvious that there is nothing difficult in the world. If you make up your mind to do it, you will certainly accomplish your end. That stands to reason.
